`General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679>`_ is a regulation on data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area. It applies to all subjects operating inside of the EU or the subjects that manage data of EU citizens.

By joining the server a strawberry.py instance manages you agree with data collection on your user account. It is the server owner's responsibility to clearly disclose this information, not the bot developer's or mantainer's.

The strawberry.py framework is free and open source, released under the GNU GPL v3 licence. You are free to read and study the source code and to make any modifications, as long as you follow the licence requirements. Bot owners may also include non-public or third-party modules that extend official strawberry.py's functionality. strawberry.py's developers hold no responsibility for this third-party code.

Official modules are available in its `GitHub organisation repositories <https://github.com/strawberry-py>`_.

By using strawberry.py framework you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your username.

strawberry.py stores some user information in order to provide its services to the users. This includes, but is not limited to, user ID, user name and server nickname, user avatar and the information derived from them. It may also store message data or metadata, reaction data or metadata and all the data linked to usage of strawberry.py's services.

Some of management modules may also require the user to submit their e-mail address or additional information in order to prove their identity. Some modules may collect information about user account activity in order to monitor the server and to prevent service abuse. By submitting such data you agree with its collection and processing.

Bot owner and bot host provider have to comply with the GDPR rules and the rules above.

Example strawberry.py instances are run by the core development team. The data won't be shared with a third party for advertisement or for-profit purposes. The core development team reserves the right to share the data or its portion with trusted third party ("The Processor") in order to do necessary actions such as data protection, backups or other means of manipulation with user data.

Users have the right to request copy of their data or to request its deletion ("The right of erasure"). While some information may be deleted, selected server management data (e.g. ban information) won't be deleted to prevent service abuse.
